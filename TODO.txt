Here's the production readiness TODO list, organized by priority:

  ---
  Critical (must-have before prod)

  1. Implement authentication — No real auth exists. Users log in with just name/email, no password or OAuth. First user auto-becomes admin.
  2. Add server-side authorization to all Convex mutations — Every mutation (delete departments, change roles, modify questions, etc.) is unprotected.
  Anyone can call them directly. The codebase has a TODO comment acknowledging this at src/context.tsx:24.
  3. Restrict query visibility — sessions.list, users.list, invitations.list return ALL data to ANY user. User A can see User B's audit history and
  invitation emails.
  4. Add server-side role checks for admin operations — Admin-only actions (manage departments, questions, roles, company settings) are only gated in the
  UI. A non-admin can call the mutations directly.

  High Priority

  5. Add loading states/skeletons — Pages render empty or flash before data loads. No loading indicators on Dashboard, AuditStartPage, or HistoryPage while
  Convex queries are pending.
  6. Handle empty questions edge case — AuditPage renders blank if a department has 0 questions. No empty state or redirect.
  7. Add error tracking — No Sentry, LogRocket, or equivalent. Errors in production will be invisible.
  8. Add auditSessions.by_auditorId index — The resume feature queries sessions by auditorId, but there's no index for it. Will degrade at scale.
  9. Input validation beyond types — No max-length on text fields, no sanitization. Convex schema only validates types, not content.
  10. Handle department deletion during active audit — If a department is deleted while someone is mid-audit, the in-progress session becomes orphaned with
  no recovery path.

  Medium Priority

  11. Add pagination to HistoryPage — All sessions load at once. Will break with thousands of audits.
  12. Add pagination to sessions.list query — Context loads ALL sessions on app init. Needs cursor-based pagination or date-range scoping.
  13. Complete the invitation flow — Invitations are created but never transition to "accepted". No acceptance mechanism exists.
  14. Add audit trail/change log — No record of who changed settings, questions, or roles.
  15. Add component tests — Only utility functions are tested (37 tests). Zero component tests, zero mutation tests, zero E2E tests.
  16. Add environment variable validation — No startup check that required env vars (Convex URL, etc.) are set. No .env.example for onboarding.
  17. Configure CSP headers — No Content Security Policy headers configured.
  18. Add keyboard navigation to audit flashcards — Arrow keys don't navigate between questions. Limited accessibility.
  19. Mobile chart responsiveness — Recharts charts on DashboardPage may render too narrow on small screens.
  20. Question versioning — Editing/deleting a question silently breaks references in past audit sessions. Scores are preserved but the question text is
  lost.

  Low Priority (nice-to-have)

  21. Add search/filter for questions in Settings — Currently only browsable by collapsing department sections.
  22. Bulk import/export of questions — No way to import questions from CSV or export them.
  23. Department duplication — Can't copy a department's question set to create a similar one.
  24. User deactivation — No way to disable a user without deleting their audit history.
  25. Data export/backup — No way to export company data for backup.
  26. Invitation expiration — Pending invitations never expire.
  27. Remove hardcoded base path — vite.config.ts sets base: '/' by default, configurable via VITE_BASE_PATH.
  28. Add analytics/event tracking — No usage metrics collection.

  That's 28 tickets. Items 1–4 are true blockers — everything else can ship behind them in priority order.


  Batch 1: Auth & Security (PCT-1, 2, 3, 4, 9) — must go first                                                                                              
  All touch convex/*.ts mutations/queries. Can't do 2-4 without 1 (auth) in place first. Input validation (9) fits naturally since you're already modifying
  every mutation.
