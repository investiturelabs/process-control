# CONVEX SERVER ENV VARS (NOT stored in .env.local)
#
# These run on Convex's cloud, so they must be set on your
# deployment via CLI or dashboard — .env files won't work.
#
# Set via CLI:
#   npx convex env set CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN "https://<your-clerk-domain>.clerk.accounts.dev"
#
# Or via dashboard:
#   https://dashboard.convex.dev → your deployment → Settings → Environment Variables
# ============================================================

# CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN — Required for auth. This is your Clerk
# instance's issuer URL, used in convex/auth.config.ts to validate JWTs.
# Find it in Clerk dashboard → JWT Templates, or derive from your publishable key.
# Example: https://unbiased-grizzly-20.clerk.accounts.dev
